    """
       Generates large amounts of data by calling the `generate` function multiple times.
       The number of times `generate` is called is determined randomly within a range of 10 to 21 times.
       This function generates random datasets, where each dataset has a random number of points
       and a calculated value for `k`, and appends the generated data to the "out_path.csv" file.
       Parameters:
           DIM (int): The number of dimensions for the generated points. This value is passed to the
                      `generate_data` function to specify how many dimensions each point will have.
       Returns: None
       Requirements:
           The function will call `part1.generate_data` multiple times, where each call generates a dataset with:
               - A random number of points (between 30 and 1000).
               - A calculated value for `k` (the number of clusters, `k = currentN // 10`).
               - The output is saved to "out_path.csv".
       Notes:
           - The number of times `generate` is called is randomized between 10 and 21 times.
           - The number of points (`currentN`) for each dataset is also randomized between 30 and 1000.
           - Each dataset will have a corresponding number of clusters (`currentK`), calculated as `currentN // 10`.
